Problem: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
Example:
For strs = ["flower","flow","flight"], the function should return "fl".
For strs = ["dog","racecar","car"], the function should return "" since there is no common prefix.
