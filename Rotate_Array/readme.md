Rotate Array:

Problem: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.
Example: If the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k is 3, the rotated array should be [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

My solution 

i look for k in the array then i remove then i append in into the beginning of the array thus making it looked flipped
