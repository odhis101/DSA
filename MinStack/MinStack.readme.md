Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) — Pushes the element x onto the stack.
pop() — Removes the element on the top of the stack.
top() — Retrieves the element on the top of the stack.
get_min() — Retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
