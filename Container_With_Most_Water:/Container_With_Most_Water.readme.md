Problem: Given an array of non-negative integers height, where each element represents the height of a vertical line, determine the maximum area that can be formed between two vertical lines by selecting two indices.

Function Signature: def max_area(height: List[int]) -> int

height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
max_area(height)  # Output: 49
