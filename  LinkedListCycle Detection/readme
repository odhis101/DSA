# Linked List Cycle Detection

## Failed Attempt: Checking Length

# I initially attempted to detect a cycle by checking if the length of the linked list is odd or even. Here's the code for the failed attempt in Python:

''' python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Flawed logic: Checking if the length is odd or even to detect a cycle
def has_cycle_flawed(head):
    length = 0

    # Calculate the length of the linked list
    current = head
    while current:
        length += 1
        current = current.next

    # Check if the length is odd or even
    return length % 2 != 0
