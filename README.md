This is a repo where we ask data structure and algorithim questions and we try solve them. I first try my solution and then look for others if its any better or slighly unique.
I am currently just practicing Data strucutures and algorithims if anyone is intrested in how i solved them i also added a readme with psuedo code and what i was thinking when i solved them 
feel free to use it as a study guide or hit me up if you think there is a challenge you would like me to complete
